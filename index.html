			<h1>Welcome to the Paisley Philatelic Society</h1>
			<img src="images/abbeys.jpg" alt="Paisley Abbey" style="float:right"/>
			<p>Regrettably, due to dwindling membership and attendances at meetings plus the after effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been decided that Paisley Philatelic Society can no longer continue to function. Hence, as of end of August 2021, Paisley Philatelic Society has ceased operations. The last meeting was held on 11th March 2020 just before "Lockdown" brought proceedings to an abrupt halt.
                        <p>It was agreed by the remaining members that we could not simply just struggle on so it was decided that we should just give up the fight. 
                        <p)Membership recorded in the earliest syllabus located in the archives from session 1949/50 was 45, with 21 junior members. This grew to a peak or over ninety in 1979. At its peak there were a number of well-known and eminent philatelists as members. 
                        <p>However, as with all other clubs, not just in philately, it has been a struggle to maintain and attract new members and, despite moving to afternoon meetings, attendances have dropped off noticeably. Sadly we cannot keep going. A number of the members are members of other societies so they are not lost to the hobby. Sadly we lost two members of the Society in the last two years due to ill-health (not COVID-19). The age profile of our membership is against us and, despite trying, we have been unable to attract younger members â€“ not an unusual feature for Clubs and Societies similar to us.
