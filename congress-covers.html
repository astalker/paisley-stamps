<h1>Congress Covers  and "The Scotia"</h1>

<p>The Society is an active member of The Association of Scottish Philatelic Societies (ASPS). In 1967 and 1976, under the Presidencies of Mr J.S. Donaldson, well known as a collector of London Postmarks and Mr A.B.McMillan, whose collection of Arctic and Antarctica was renowned, the Society was hosts to the Annual Congress held at Stirling University. Special Covers were designed for the latter occasion, serviced with a special commemorative cancellation by the Post Office. These covers featured the R.R.S. John Biscoe, a survey ship built by Fleming and Ferguson of Paisley for the British Antarctic Survey. The cover was designed by Peter Westwood.</p>

Congress was held in Falkirk Town Hall at the time and a special commemorative cover was again designed by Peter Westwood (shown below). The cover featured the 1904 Scotia expedition to Coats Land in Antarctica and the scans of the invite card to welcome the Scotia home on 21st July 1904 are shown below.

<p>Since the first Annual Congress of the South West of Scotland Philatelic Societies in 1963, Paisley Philatelic Society has been represented each year and has hosted on a number of occasions. South West Congress (now renamed as a Stamp and Postcard Fair) has now settled in to a regular venue at Prestwick Community Centre in early October of each year and a number of stamp and postcard dealers attend to sell their wares. SW Congress in 1977 was hosted by Paisley Philatelic Society and a card commemorating the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II was produced.</p>
